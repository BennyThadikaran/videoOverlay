Fixed

- Last Overlay not hidden at end of video.
- Fixed video size and image sizes of overlay.
- Clicking on the video now brings up overlay of all products.
- Added Scrolling for large number of items.
- Added Modal box support with Image, product details and buy button.
- Overlays can now be clicked to open Modal box displaying product details.
- Pause video when modal is open and vice versa.
- Added Product title to overlays.
- Modal contents are now dynamically generated as per product clicked.
- Integrated youtube api with existing code.


To Do
